[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2866e5a514004498b463c49e0ec00b71)](https://app.codacy.com/app/Franckeddy/blog-for-a-writer?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Franckeddy/blog-for-a-writer&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

Simple blog application in PHP with a MySQL database. Frontend interface (ticket reading) and a backend interface (ticket administration for writing).

Each ticket allows the addition of comments, which are moderated in the administration interface if necessary.
Readers can "flag" comments to make it easier to navigate through the admin interface to be moderated.

Password protected administration interface. Writing of banknotes in a WYSIWYG interface based on TinyMCE.

Develop in PHP without using a framework. Code built on an MVC architecture.
