Simple blog application in PHP with a MySQL database. Frontend interface (ticket reading) and a backend interface (ticket administration for writing).

Each ticket allows the addition of comments, which are moderated in the administration interface if necessary.
Readers can "flag" comments to make it easier to navigate through the admin interface to be moderated.

Password protected administration interface. Writing of banknotes in a WYSIWYG interface based on TinyMCE.

Develop in PHP without using a framework. Code built on an MVC architecture.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

**[Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/)** is an automated code analysis/quality tool that helps developers ship better software, faster. With Codacy, you get static analysis, cyclomatic complexity, duplication and code unit test coverage changes in every commit and pull request.

You can use Codacy to enforce your code quality standard, save time in code reviews, enforce security best practices and onboard developers faster. Integrate with your GitHub repositories to get quality analysis of every pull request inside GitHub.

```
_Integrated in your workflow_
 Codacy adapts to your code review process, pushing results as comments in your pull requests and commits into your workflow in GitHub.

_Track your quality evolution_
 Get a code quality glance at your project and track its quality evolution over time, easily paying back your technical debt.Give an example
